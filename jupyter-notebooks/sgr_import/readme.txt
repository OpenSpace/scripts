This catalogue contains 55192 stars with high probability of being part of the Sagittarius stream.
The selection criteria are described in Section 2 of Vasiliev, Belokurov & Erkal 2020.
Columns:
1-2:   ra, dec   - celestial coordinates [deg]
3-4:   parallax, parallax error from Gaia DR2 [mas]
5-6:   pmra, pmra_error - proper motion in RA [mas/yr]
7-8:   pmdec, pmdec_error - same in DEC [mas/yr]
9:     g_mag - Gaia G-band magnitude
10:    bp_rp - Gaia colour index BP-RP
11-13: j_mag, h_mag, k_mag - 2MASS magnitudes
14:    E(B-V) - reddening from SFD98
15-16: distance, distance_error - estimate of the distance from nearby RR Lyrae stars [kpc]
17-18: v_los, v_los_error - heliocentric line-of-sight velocity (for a subset of ~4500 stars) [km/s]
19-20: [Fe/H], [Fe/H]_error - metallicity (for an even smaller subset of stars)
21:    source of spectroscopic data for the previous four columns:
       1 = APOGEE
       2 = LAMOST
       3 = GAIA RVS
       4 = SIMBAD  (including data from Frinchaboy+ 2012)
       5 = SDSS
       6 = Penarrubia+ 2011
22-23: Lambda, Beta - celestial coordinates in the Sgr stream frame; Lambda>0 in the leading arm [deg]
